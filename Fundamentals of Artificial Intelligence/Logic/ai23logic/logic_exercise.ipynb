    "\n",
    "[Organic Order](https://www.lumosity.com/en/brain-games/organic-order/) is a brain-training game developed by Lumosity, it focuses on logical reasoning by arranging fruits or vegetables in a specific order, following explicit stated rules and implicit ones inferred through observation and deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial configuration is given as a list of strings. This list has length x, corresponding to the x organic elements that may be involved in this scenario. The elements of the list specify the initial positions of certain elements. For example, `['Carrot','*','Grape','*','*']` represents the following initial ordering: TODO (image)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a list of logical statements are given; from these rules, implicit rules have to be deduced. The goal is to assign a position to each plant into the initial layout while following all given rules. This is achieved by filling a knowledge base with logical sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing the exercise\n",
    "You will have passed the exercise if you can successfully solve all **4 general** and **7 rule-specific scenarios** that are given to you together with this template. Additionally, your code also has to solve **2 hidden scenarios**, that are only available on Artemis. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: you cannot solve this exercise by hardcoding the solutions for the scenarios given in this template. In order to also solve the scenarios hidden on Artemis, you need to implement the knowledge base with logical sentences in a correct way._\n",
    "\n",
    "If your implemented function computes the knowledge base such that every scenario is solved correctly (including the hidden ones), you successfully completed this programming exercise. Your code has to compute a valid solution for **each** of the scenarios **within 5 min** on our machine. If your code takes longer to compute a solution, you will fail this submission. Don't worry about the computation time too much as usually the algorithm produces a solution **within two minutes** for our specific exercise. Your submission will be evaluated after the deadline, but until then you can update your solution as many times as you like. The last submitted solution will be graded."
